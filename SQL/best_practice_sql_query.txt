Best practices for writing SQL quesries:

✅ Write SQL keywords in capital letters.

✅ Use table aliases with columns when you are joining multiple tables.

✅ Avoid SELECT * for better performance, always mention list of columns in select clause.

✅ Add useful comments wherever you write complex logic. Avoid too many comments.

✅ Use joins instead of subqueries when possible for better performance.

✅ Create CTEs instead of multiple sub queries , it will make your query easy to read.

✅ Join tables using JOIN keywords instead of writing join condition in where clause for better readability.

✅ Never use order by in sub queries , It will unnecessary increase runtime.

✅ If you know there are no duplicates in 2 tables, use UNION ALL instead of UNION for better performance.

✅ Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns in WHERE To maintain indexing efficiency.
